# Gielinor-Resources

This resource pack is dedicated to bringing a unique Runescape experience into Minecraft. Initial projects towards the Gielinor project were started years ago, presently date-less until I can find a reference accurate enough to determine when this started. This resource has been actively being produced for a little over a year.
