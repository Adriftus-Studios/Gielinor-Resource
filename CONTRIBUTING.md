## Code of Conduct
> The legal stuff - Quick and simply you can share and adapt this content under terms of attribution, non commercial and sharealike specifications listed below with no warranties given.

### User Concluded, Legal Shmegal

This project and everyone participating is agree to grant broad permissions to the general public to re-distribute and re-use their contributions freely, subject to the terms of the corresponding licenses. By editing any content, you agree to license any text or content you add under the project's Creative Commons License.

As a contributor, you agree to be attributed by any of:
- A link where possible or URL to the commits or relative documents you contributed to
- Any stable host providing reference of the content which conforms with the license and which provides credit to the contributors in a manner equivalent to the credit given
- Reference of insights of public repositories

### Fostering Our Environment

For all code Implementation, please make sure this is your own work or that it is sufficiently credited. In the case that someone has asked you, or you are someone requesting a current active contributor or maintainer to implement your contribution, we ask that who-ever has created the content to contribute this themselves from their own GitHub account. We offer oAuth connections and applications available to process handling the repository forks for you to better expedite the grunt-work behind setting up a workplace, however it is not required to fork and create a pull request with your contributions. As mentioned in the intro, please don't be afraid to ask if not knowing how prevents you from contributing. We're here to help you help us if that's the case.

In the case that the content being contributed is not yours or references content from another source, we ask and strongly recommend that you credit where credit belongs, just as we request that the person contributing is the one contributing as themselves as referenced in the previous paragraph. There's no shame in mentioning you found something cool someplace and made the effort to contribute it to our project - so long as we credit both people for the great work.

Content with functions must verifiable working, or be evident that it would work. Testing is the best way to verify that something you've made functions properly. A good rule of thumb is that if you can provide evidence (eg, a screenshot or a video) of the feature working, you likely won't be questioned whether or not you've tested this. We ask that you take adequate time to thoroughly verify your content works; Even a single active developer for a scripting language that they primarily coordinate the design and function for will typically cross-reference their documentation and meta for content when working with their own language.

Lastly, while this guide is meant to be guideline for contribution, we strongly request you abide code styles, formatting, and by no means obfuscate any content.

## What should I know before I get started?

> As a whole, we're particular about what goes where. Please take appropriate due diligence to research where content belongs before attempting to contribute.

### Adriftus

## Can I Contribute?

> Understanding what guidelines to follow can be outlined by directing at the relevant sections referring to the type of contribution you want to appoint.

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand the report and best find relevant information.

Before creating a bug report, please verify there are no reports of relevant borked issues. Duplicate issues can often create a mess, but in the case that it's relevant information to an existing report, it may be a beneficial addition regardless. When creating a bug report, please use the following guidelines:
- [include as much detail as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report). 
- If you find a Closed issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one. 
- If you find an Open issue that seems like it is the same thing you're experiencing, please verify that it in-fact is, and provide as much context as possible as if it were an issue in a comment attached to the relevant issue.
- Determine [which repository the problem should be reported in](#Relevant Repositories).
- If you're unsure of any steps after reviewing this section, contact us on our [Discord](http://discord.adriftus.com).

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as GitHub issues. After you've determined which repository your bug is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information by filling in the template.

Explain the problem and include additional details to help reproduce the problem:
  - Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.
  - Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem in as many details as possible.
  - When listing steps, don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it. 
  - Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps. Include links to files, or copy/pasteable snippets.
  - Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
  - Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.
  - Include screenshots and/or animated GIFs which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. 
  - If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.

Provide more context by answering these questions:
  - Did the problem start happening recently or was this always a problem?
  - If the problem hasn't just started happening recently, when did you first notice or hear of this happening? Please provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.
  - If the problem is related to working with files (e.g. opening and editing files), does the problem happen for all files and projects or only some? Does the problem happen only when working with local or remote files (e.g. on network drives), with files of a specific type (e.g. only Denizen Scripts or a specific extension of files), with large files or files with very long lines, or with files in a specific encoding? Is there anything else special about the files you are using?

### Feature Requests

> New things are always exciting; We're always open to new ideas, general enhancements, and suggestions for new or existing content.

This section guides you through submitting a feature request, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality. Following these guidelines helps us understand your suggestion and find relevant suggestions that mesh well as a whole, creating a pinata of creativity.

#### Good Requests

**Good** feature requests should provide as many of these notes as possible:
- **The Type of request**: describe if this a one-off feature or a series of features
- **Who is requesting this**: identify yourself and who you represent, so that you can easily follow up with them as a major contributing producer to the idea.
- **Describe the feature** This is key for you to differentiate between people that have deeply thought about what you're requesting, or what this will solve for users versus those that are just in love with their idea.
- **Describe the impact**: Articulate how solving this problem will make yours and the other playerâ€™s life better. You can add impact categories that matter to you to ensure consistency.
- **Describe the reach of this feature**: You could describe how many users will be positively impacted or leverage this feature.
- **Describe the cost of not doing this request**: Describe the problems that would occur if this need was not addressed. To ensure consistency add categories that matter to us such as happier players, or adequate equality of other existing features or mechanics of the game.
- **Describe which goals this helps**: Enumerate our current goals and tie the feature to it - Expansion and dynamistic game-play is key for an awesome player-base and game-play environment.
- **Describe the evidence that you have on the need for this request**: Validation of user problem and desired outcome is statistically(no pun intended) the only way to argue with me if you believe I wouldn't agree else-wise. 
- **Describe if you have any ideas on how we may solve this**: Giving the space to help and suggest ideas are great for creating structural or dynamic features, mini-games and commands.
- **Describe how urgent this is and why**: Explain the space to give insight into the urgency of this issue and why.

Generally, features and suggestions should avoid the following:
- Inequality: Give substantial benefits to a single player, or small group of individual players. We aren't providing random benefits to anyone who asks. *unless of course, they're a sponsor*. Privileged players typically receive special treatment. Call it a trip on our magic carpet.
- Over-complicated or game-breaking changes; Examples:
  - Pouring milk like water or lava - this is mechanically too complicated without creating complete modifications to the server that all players would have to own to participate playing (ie, mods)
  - Instant-killing attacking enemies - this isn't a realistic request, and would slaughter our less skilled or otherwise expecting players, unless it's something incredibly prepped for, such as a final-boss battle of a sort.
- Uncontrollable growth - Such as, 'the entire Diablo III quest series saga and RPG Adventure Gamemode'. This is too in-depth and too expandable for a single request without offering to contribute towards forming a sub-community to organize this type of request.

Feature requests should also bear in mind general terms and conditions placed by Mojang. This information can be found [`[Here]`](https://account.mojang.com/terms#commercial).

## Styleguides

> Maintaining a consistent and stylistic pattern of systems and usage of scripts, data and documentation is important as an overall look and feel.

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Use the imperative mood ("Move file to..." not "Moves file to...").
- Avoid formatting characters in the first line.
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.
- Avoid defaulted GitHub commit messages ("Consistency updates" not "Update FILE.dsc")
- Reference code blocks and sections with the \`Tilde\` code wrapping format, whether it's formatted where referenced or not.

### Denizen Styleguide

- In general, follow the language meta found on the [`[Denizen Script D1 Meta Docs]`](https://one.denizenscript.com/denizen/lngs/).
- Never utilize raw object notation.
- Avoid platform-dependent code. The best practice for writing Denizen scripts is to write and test in Spigot which Denizen is built on, and additionally verifying tests in live production versions.
- Avoid object hacking - it's unreliable to assume that the full object format for an object is going to be a certain way. There's always a tag to read or change any data within an object.
- Preference our stylistic usage of specific commands, tags and general usage:
  - Utilize standard constructors instead of object conversion sub-tags ("`<player[UUID]>`" not "`<[UUID].as_player>`").
  - Avoid over-using constructor tags if commands recognize object by literal input ("`Gold_Block`" not "`<material[Gold_Block]>`").
  - Avoid over-using a constructor if creating an object when simply adding mechanisms ("`stone[lore=rocky]`" not "`<item[stone].with[lore=rocky]>`").
  - Avoid ternary logic when unnecessary - `if`/`else if`/`else` is preferred over cramming it in a `<tern[].pass[].fail[]>`.
  - Don't overuse fallbacks, especially where boolean tags exist to verify if a comparison or line of logic exists.
  - Use a try/catch methods instead of nested `if` trees. If a condition would halt the entire script, do that as opposed to building a long nested `if` statement.
  - Assume perfection to the best of your ability - If something is capable of going sideways if something strange happens, create logic to prevent it. Never assume that a player will do something exactly as intended.
  - Prioritize colored commentary as opposed to random or "bloated" commentary
  - Utilize a newline at the end of the file.

### JSON Styleguide

- In general, follow the spec found at [`[JSON.org]`](https://www.json.org/json-en.html).
- For any customized property names, utilize snake_case, entirely lowercased unless specifically required per any REST APIs that require case sensitive properties.
- Avoid commentary in JSON objects unless specifically indicated to attribute per a specific source license.
- Flattened data vs Structured Hierarchy - Data should not be arbitrarily grouped for convenience.
- Utilize a newline at the end of the file.

### Documentation Styleguide

- Utilize markdown formatting.
- Utilize present tense formatting.
- Utilize punctuation where possible.
- Use our hyperlink markdown pattern:
  ```example
  [`[Visible text]`](https://url)
  ```
- Utilize a newline at the end of the file.
- Utilize English spelling over British spelling. ("Armor" not "Armour")
  - see also [`[American and British English spelling differences]`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_and_British_English_spelling_differences) and [`[variations]`](http://www.english-for-students.com/Spelling-Variations.html).
